# Project Title: India's Crop Data Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I meticulously analyzed agricultural data spanning 20 years using Power BI, with a focus on crop production trends and diversity. The dataset, comprising over 240,000 entries, underwent careful cleaning and structuring using Power Query and Excel to ensure accuracy. Key highlights of the dataset include:

* Conducted an Analysis of 70 Distinct Crop Types.
* Totaled 141.18 Billion Units of Crop Produce.
* Covered an Area of 2.95 Billion Units.
* Calculated an Average Production of 427.53 Thousand Units per Season.

Implementing DAX Measures: I Uncovered Insightful Metrics, Culminating in Interactive Power BI Dashboards for Informed Decision-Making.
The Skills Developed Encompassed Data Cleansing, Visualization, Executing DAX Calculations, Interpreting Data, and Engaging Stakeholders. This Experience Equipped Me to Derive Actionable Insights and Drive Informed Decisions in Agriculture.
